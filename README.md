# Technical SEO Framework

## ðŸ’¬ About:
- This is a project I did to create a technical SEO measurement framework for auditing and measureing progress fixing about 50 website issues that can hinder techncal SEO performance. The framework is based on the audit functionality in SEMRush, and needs data from a crawler to be inputted so it can work correctly. Each item on the audit tab is either (pass/fail) and this will then dynamically update the scoring tab to give an idea of how 'healthy' a site is for technical SEO best practice.

## ðŸ’¾ Files in this repo are:
- **Technical SEO Framework.xlxs** - this is the file that containe the audit template and the measurement framework and it is based off of functionality contained within SEMRush.

## âš¡ Next Steps:
- This framework is based on SEMrush, although it could be updated to be based off of Screaming Frog too and that might suit some use cases better as Screaming Frog can be run locally. This framework also needs to be updated with current best practice based on Google's technical recommendations.
